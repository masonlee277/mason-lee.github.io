        <img src="images/me-1.JPEG" alt="Mason Lee" class="profile-image" />
        <p>
          I'm Mason Lee, a Machine Learning and Applied Math student at Brown
          University with a passion for applying AI to environmental challenges.
          My background spans from wildland firefighting to cutting-edge
          research in machine learning for earth systems. I'm particularly
          interested in using deep learning techniques to tackle climate change
          and improve disaster response.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work experience includes roles at NASA, where I've applied machine
          learning to fluid dynamics and wildfire research, and at Brown
          University, where I've contributed to projects in river connectivity
          and disaster migration dynamics. I'm also the co-founder of Pluto Los
          Angeles, an experimental event space that has given me unique
          experience in project management and marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics and work, I'm an avid big wall climber, Jiu Jitsu
          practitioner, and DJ. I'm always looking for new challenges and
          opportunities to apply my skills in machine learning, environmental
          modeling, and software engineering to real-world problems.

          <summary>Description</summary>
          <p>
            This paper explores the use of graph neural networks to model
            migration patterns in the US in response to natural disasters. It
            analyzes county-level migration data and disaster declarations to
            understand how climate-related events impact population movements.

          Improving Probabilistic Model Based Reinforcement Learning Control in
          Chaotic Environments with Conditional Normalizing Flows
        </h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <p>
            This research introduces a novel model-based reinforcement learning
            algorithm called CNF-MC-PILCO. It uses Gaussian Processes and
            Conditional Normalizing Flows to model system dynamics and estimate
            policy gradients using a Monte Carlo approach.

          Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Neural Networks for Sea Surface Temperature
          Prediction
        </h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <p>
            This study presents the application of multi-fidelity learning and
            Bayesian optimization for predicting sea surface temperature. It
            implements two models: a multi-fidelity neural network and a
            multi-fidelity Gaussian Process, comparing their performance in
            data-sparse environments.

          SINDy-PETS: A Flexible Physics-Informed and Probabilistic MBRL

        </h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <p>
            This paper proposes a novel approach to model-based reinforcement
            learning by combining probabilistic models with physics-based
            models. It introduces two methods for incorporating physics-informed
            bias into Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS):
            Residual Correction and Opinion Input.

          Sensitivity of simulated wildfire spread to parameter uncertainty and
          spatial resolution of terrain and fuel maps
        </h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <p>
            This study examines the sensitivity of wildfire spread simulations
            to various parameters and spatial resolutions. It uses the ELMFIRE
            model to simulate the 2020 Creek Fire in California, exploring the
            impacts of spotting, wind conditions, and fuel characteristics on
            fire behavior predictions.
