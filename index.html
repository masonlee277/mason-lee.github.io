        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/me-1.JPEG" alt="Mason Lee" class="profile-image" />
        <p>
          I'm Mason Lee, a Machine Learning and Applied Math student at Brown
          University with a passion for applying AI to environmental challenges.
          My background spans from wildland firefighting to cutting-edge
          research in machine learning for earth systems. I'm particularly
          interested in using deep learning techniques to tackle climate change
          and improve disaster response.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work experience includes roles at NASA, where I've applied machine
          learning to fluid dynamics and wildfire research, and at Brown
          University, where I've contributed to projects in river connectivity
          and disaster migration dynamics. I'm also the co-founder of Pluto Los
          Angeles, an experimental event space that has given me unique
          experience in project management and marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics and work, I'm an avid big wall climber, Jiu Jitsu
          practitioner, and DJ. I'm always looking for new challenges and
          opportunities to apply my skills in machine learning, environmental
          modeling, and software engineering to real-world problems.
